dataframe.tsv contains Wendelin Bitzan's original annotations.

The TXT files contain (algorithmically but not completely) corrected versions thereof.

### What has been corrected:

* Old organ point notation has been changed to the new (but closing brackets are missing)
* Missing leading dots have been added
* Most of the Mazurkas start with a single note pickup and every time, the label looked like .a.@none which is syntactically incorrect. These have been fixed manually.
