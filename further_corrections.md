# First merge - first correction

* many symbols starting with b without leading dot
* many first symbols indicate key with following @none, e.g. .C.@none (most of the pieces start with a single not pick-up)


# Remaining errors

* ~~Repeated identical symbols~~
* Organ points miss ending brackets
* Suspensions have been annotated as organ points
* @none wherever only one voice is sounding
* Long major sections annotated within local minor key (e.g. BI126-3op41-1, mm. 49ff.)
* V(64) written as v64 or i64
* check BI77-3op17-3_labelled.mscx from m. 40 onwards -> bar count problem
* In voltas, there are only labels for the second volta - but they might be inserted in the first
